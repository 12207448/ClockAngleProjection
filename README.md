# Clock Angle Projection (CAP)

## Overview
Clock Angle Projection (CAP) is a Python-based project that calculates the angle between the hour and minute hands of an analog clock at a given time. It provides an efficient solution for solving time-angle problems and understanding the relationship between time and angular measurements.

## Features
- **Accurate Angle Calculation**: Computes the exact angle between the hour and minute hands for any given time.
- **Simple Input**: Enter time in `HH:MM` format, and get the result instantly.
- **Scalable and Efficient**: Optimized for quick calculations with minimal computational overhead.

## Usage Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Clone the repository using the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/12207448/ClockAngleProjection.git
     ```
   - Navigate into the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd ClockAngleProjection
     ```

2. **Run the Script**
   - Execute the script using Python:
     ```bash
     python cap_code.py
     ```
   - Enter the time in the required format (e.g., `03:15`), and the script will return the calculated angle.

3. **Sample Output**
   ```
   Input: 03:15
   Output: The angle between the hands is 7.5 degrees.
   ```

## Requirements
- Python 3.x installed
- Any Python-compatible IDE or terminal
